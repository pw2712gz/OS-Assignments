In my Computer Operating Systems assignment, I developed a solution to the producer-consumer problem using Python. I created a program where a producer thread increments a shared 'data' variable up to 8, with random delays to mimic real production cycles. A consumer thread then aggregates these values, ensuring thread safety through mutual exclusion with a lock. The process ends when the producer signals termination by setting 'data' to -1, leading the consumer to print the total sum, which successfully resulted in 28. This exercise reinforced my understanding of concurrency, synchronization, and the management of shared resources in a programming context.
