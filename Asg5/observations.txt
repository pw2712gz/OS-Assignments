When we look at how the FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms work with different numbers of page frames, we see some interesting trends. With just one page frame available, all three algorithms end up having the same number of page faults, which makes sense because there's limited space to work with. As we increase the number of page frames, we start to see fewer page faults across the board. This tells us that having more memory available naturally leads to better performance. Among the three, the Optimal algorithm often comes out on top, showing the fewest page faults. This isn't surprising since Optimal has the advantage of knowing future page requests, which the others don't. This comparison really highlights how memory management strategies can make a big difference in managing system resources effectively.
